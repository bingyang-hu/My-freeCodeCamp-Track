## Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with **text-align** property:

```
h4 {
  text-align:center;
}

p {
  text-align:justify;
}

```

## Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold

```
<strong> Stanford University </strong>
```

## Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text

```
<h4><s>Google</s> Alphabet</h4>

```

## Set the font-size and font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements

The **font-weight** property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

## Set the line-height of paragraphs

**line-height** changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.

## Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectos, in order to select a specific state of the element.

```

a: hover{
  color: red;
}

a {
  color: #000;
}
```
